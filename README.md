# MyNote

MyNote is a very, very simple Notepad-like editor. Note that I've developed this small editor to learn Gtkmm, Meson Build and how to do some stuff. Thus this project has basically no design, is incomplete, and contains some bugs. You can do wathever you want with it, just take a look at the GPLV-3.0 before.

# Install

## Requirements

In order to build and run MyNote, you need to have at least those installed:

- [Gtkmm](https://www.gtkmm.org/en/) and its dependencies;
- pkg-config(https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/);
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) and its dependencies;
- ninja;

## How to

- Clone/download this repository.
- Run install.sh or, if you want to change the building parameters, you can manually execute meson and ninja;
- If you want just a debug version, there is a shortcut script called build-run.sh that will build MyNote to a directory called \_\_build
 and run the built executable.
